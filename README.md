- Hi, my name Samuel Sawyer
- I'm a Computer Engineering student at Clemson University graduating in May of 2022
- While finishing up my degree, I'm also expanding my learning through education platforms like Coursera and Udemy
- I'm using Github to document my progress as I learn more about Python, DevOps Engineering, AWS, Kubernetes, and more.
- My goals for this semester are perhaps a bit ambitious... but I hope to learn a lot regardless.
